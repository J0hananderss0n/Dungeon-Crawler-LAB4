# Dungeon_Crawler_LAB4
Lab 4 ITHS av Andre√© Mattsson och Johan Andersson

Welcome to dungeon crawler!
The goal of this game is to reach the end with as much healthpoints left as possible.
You will lose healthpoints on every move you make and you will have to fight some monsters on the way.
There is also some doors that you will need to find a key to open.
Good luck!
